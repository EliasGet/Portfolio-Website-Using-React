                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>
                        I'm very ambitious front-end developer looking for a role in
                        established IT company with the opportunity to work with the latest
                        technologies on challenging and diverse projects. I have a bachelorâ€™s degree
                        in Computer Science from HiLCoE School of Computer Science and Technology and
                        a certificate in the course Responsive Web Design from freecodecamp.org.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The way I see it, a person hiring me for a job will benefit in two ways.
                        Number one: my client will always get someone who delivers on time,
                        Second: I'm always available to my clients. Hence the term, Dependable
                        and Committed. Not only will I do the job, but I will also engage myself
                        in coming up with new solutions that can solve the project better.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I believe in open and frequent communication between my clients and me so that
                        everyone involved is always on the right page. I look forward to hearing from
                        you and can't wait till we work together.
                    </p>
